# Self-driving car

I was looking out for a good and interesting project to strengthen my vanilla JS understanding's and skills I've been thought in Neuefische Bootcamp, before going to the next topic -> React.
I've to admit that I also wanted to know how Neural Networks work in programming for a longer time. So the guided Project from <strong>@Credit's to follow<strong> was the perfect match. I followed it trough, looked up everything new to me and played with it a lot.

learnings chronologically listed:

- Canvas API, drawing in JS
- JS Classes, for car & controls
- Private methods, stay's in scope#
- Keyboard events, drive car
- Asynchronous methods, promise's for car
- Update(),requestAnimationFrame(), illusion of movement
